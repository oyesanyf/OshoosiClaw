# Architecture & Governance Protocol

1. **Model Roles & Hierarchy**:
   - **Lead Architect (Gemini 3.1 Pro)**: Manage high-level reasoning, architecture decomposition, test strategies, and final verification.
   - **Worker Subagent (Gemini 3.7 Flash)**: Delegate all code editing, script generation, and terminal runs using the `invoke_subagent` tool. Set the `Model` argument to `flash` and give it a descriptive `Role` (e.g., 'Worker Subagent'). 

2. **Mandatory Iterative Loop**:
   - For all complex, low-level, or kernel-space engineering tasks, do not accept single-shot solutions.
   - **Pass 1 (Decomposition)**: Pro breaks down the task into precise functional boundaries and test criteria.
   - **Pass 2 (Execution)**: The Flash subagent implements the patch and runs validation commands.
   - **Pass 3 (Review & Iteration)**: Pro verifies the diffs; if any checks or edge cases fail, return the feedback to the Flash subagent (using `send_message`) for iteration until green.
