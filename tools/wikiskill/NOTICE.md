The benchmark adapters, Wiki edit/proposal contracts and portions of the experiment harness were extracted and adapted from **Stahl-G/briefloop**, © 2026 multi-agent-brief-workflow contributors, MIT.

`src/wikiskill/officeqa/reward.py` is a vendored Databricks OfficeQA scorer. Its Apache-2.0 license and upstream notice are in `third_party/officeqa/`. The vendored scorer's bytes are retained from the source experiment; it is not silently updated to the latest upstream code.
